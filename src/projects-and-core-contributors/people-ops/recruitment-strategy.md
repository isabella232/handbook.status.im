## Goals

  - How many hires can each team handle, how much time can leads/team contribute to interviews & onboarding to ensure succesful longterm hires.
  - How can we split these to not overburden the recruitment team and get the best out of each person

### Retension
  - Onboarding, is it consistent, enough support, we need to collect feedback from teams & contributors (past & present)
  - Development, how much development can we offer & what does/will it look like
  - Career paths, what does this look like, traditional or moving across different projects
  - Salary reviews, how often, is there a process, what's the history
