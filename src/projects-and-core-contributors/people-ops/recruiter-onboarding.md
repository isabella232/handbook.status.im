## Overview of how Status

Carl & Jarrad have been working together for about a decade on various businesses, prior to Status they ran a digital marketing firm and a software distribution business. It was actually through targeted advertising that they were exposed to how data is bought and sold, and how invasive it is, which spurred their interest in privacy-preserving technologies.
