## Overview of how Status

Carl & Jarrad have been working together for about a decade on various businesses, prior to Status they ran a digital marketing firm and a software distribution business. It was actually through targeted advertising that they were exposed to how data is bought and sold, and how invasive it is, which spurred their interest in privacy-preserving technologies.

There are several early interviews & talks on our [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Statusim/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid) channel and plenty of other content including our company stand-ups. Do take a look through [State of Us](https://our.status.im/state-of-us/)



## Recruitment Hiring workflow 

### Define Hiring Process and Job spec
Partner with the hiring manager
Create a ‚Äò[job setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxkdEvb8cA_ws2g9dP4ka0KDhfSt6eFxYi836m_EHvc/edit)‚Äô doc - this should lay out the strategy for hiring.
Tag other POps team members in the doc for input if necessary 
Save a copy in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RoTZvxXCvPUYyKzZADPmRjzZxwNN1HqU?ths=true) (NB: it‚Äôs visible to all of Status)
Get final Hiring Manager ‚Äòsign off‚Äô on JD before posting via Greenhouse
Let the rest of Status know what our plans are by posting on Discuss. Include:
Why we‚Äôre hiring for the role
An outline of the job spec
Ask for feedback from CCs
Mention the referral bonus for any referrals
Tag as `People Ops` > `Hiring`

### Job set up on Greenhouse
- ‚ÄúCreate a job‚Äù in Greenhouse 
- Add urgency level and target start date
- Configure ‚ÄúJob Setup‚Äù -> Scorecard, Interview Plan, Hiring Team etc.. to the role carefully
- If using template from prior job, check the job setup and process is still relevant 
- Ensure all hiring team members can see the scorecards (add permissions to individuals via ‚ÄúHiring Team‚Äù in ‚Äújob Setup‚Äù- basic ) 
- Submit for People ops approval - once approved will appear on Status Jobs and by default, all jobs created and published in Greenhouse are also posted to:
   - Glassdoor
   - Indeed
   - LinkedIn Limited
   - Angel.co.

### We use the following paid resources to market roles:
LinkedIn
Groups / your own profile
We have two premium job slots which we can rotate based on priority
Remember to create a tracking link in GH to direct applicants to the Status Jobs page for application
Buying blocks of adverts / monthly subscriptions for unlimited posting on specific job boards 
Can also experiment with other jobs boards and capture the info / review ROI from posting.
Speak to Stef / Pepper re payment
Any shared job board / recruitment related passwords should be stored in Bitwarden under ‚Äòrecruitment‚Äô collection
Double check with Hiring Manager for preference / relevant job boards 

### Outreach & Sourcing 
LinkedIn, Boolean/X-ray searches, GitHub, StackOverflow, Job boards, Social Media, Network, Articles, Developer / PL communities & Groups etc
LinkedIn Recruiter - currently only one seat
Marketing on paid job boards; once paid, send the invoice to billing@status.im and upload in Drive folder for our records (make sure that any invoice received meets this standard, or it will be rejected by Finance)
Again, make sure all paid ads have a dedicated tracking link to monitor effectiveness
Marketing on Social media - ping @Nickb for Status Twitter and Sacha (@0xmiel) for Nimbus Twitter- prompt teams to market the roles using their own accounts too

### Interviews & Scheduling
Set up initial prescreen using email template and calendly link via GH
Submit your scorecard and tag hiring manager / share via discord channel to review
Subsequent interviews to be scheduled via Greenhouse (or if the hiring manager prefers, use a Calendly link if they have one)
Standard process 3-4 rounds (flexible to suit needs of role, tbd in job set up doc)
Recruiter prescreen
Hiring Team 
Peer IV
Project / Written test (not in every case)
Carl/Jarrad

### Candidate experience / tracking
Move candidates to the relevant bin so pipeline can be easily understood at a glance from the job dashboard
Aim to follow up on every application. Even if we don‚Äôt wish to proceed; generic reject email template is sufficient and can be edited/personalised if necessary 
Make sure all stages of interview/evaluation have a scorecard completed (these are essential for offer approval stage)
Ensure all verbal / written communication with a candidate is logged in GH ‚ÄúActivity Feed‚Äù for continuity and positive candidate experience. Capture email interaction using email alias in Bcc: maildrop@rose.greenhouse.io  This will identify the candidate using their email and copy the thread into ‚ÄúActivity Feed‚Äù for you.
Communicate a ‚Äòrejection‚Äô with candidate in a timely manner via email or verbally, depending on stage of process 
Give high level overview of progress in weekly team syncs, otherwise Greenhouse is the source of truth for latest updates
Consider using text-based interviews via Discord as People Ops pre-screens to assess for remote work skills/communication

### Communicating with hiring team 
Open a group chat, e.g. POps <> Nimbus hiring and add the hiring team (exc. C&J)
Keep in regular communication, updates, chasing feedback etc (frequency depends on urgency)
For any discussion with C&J on hiring, do this in a shared channel (e.g. #ops) so all the team can follow along 
Generally speaking, email is not checked regularly, so if it‚Äôs urgent, use Discord!

### Offer approval
Once the right candidate is found and the hiring team have given a green light on hiring, it‚Äôs time to submit an offer for approval in the #Ops channel. Here the proposed salary + SNT can be approved/adjusted by Carl/Ruslan. (example)
Once approved you can verbally offer the candidate
Follow up with an email to confirm the offer in writing (Cc Terry)  and request relevant information for Terry to draft their Services Agreement (example) 
Also ping Terry with the following:
Who this person will report to
5-10 bullet points for the SA which outline the scope of work / responsibilities 

### Contract signed (yay!) 
Once the candidate has signed the SA, Terry will notify the Recruiter. Make sure you:
‚Äúmark candidate as hired‚Äù in Greenhouse and export the data to BambooHR
Make sure all hiring history data, audit trail, email correspondence, notes, feedback etc is on the record
Communicate the good news with the hiring manager and confirm the start date once more
Always ensure all hired candidates are marked as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù. This will prevent them being able to see confidential material about themselves, if later added to GH as a Hiring Manager
Take the job offline, close out any remaining active candidates (..unless hiring multiples! Create a new job ID in the existing job, keep open and continue hiring..)
Terry to pick up onboarding from there
If hire is a referral, please track successful hires in this spreadsheet and ping Jason 3 months after hire to pay out the SNT referral bonus

### Retrospective 
Put together a summary of learnings, outcomes, ROI on ad spend
Suggest any process or hiring improvements


## Tools/Platforms

We use a variety of tools & platforms and encourage everyone to use their own preferances depending on the role that are being hired, this includes new job boards, platforms & tools that haven't been used before. Generally we keep all the platforms open [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G1Wy5EKeZX_c8zzA2TZ_NFw6UgdeEqoro2aSAieTHLQ/edit?usp=sharing) and edit them as we go

Generally we like to work smart, meaning using platforms that will get the best results & attract the right candidates and that can be discussed with the hiring teams too as some have preferences.
