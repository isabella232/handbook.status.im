## Overview of how Status was formed

Carl & Jarrad have been working together for about a decade on various businesses, prior to Status they ran a digital marketing firm and a software distribution business. It was actually through targeted advertising that they were exposed to how data is bought and sold, and how invasive it is, which spurred their interest in privacy-preserving technologies.

There are several early interviews & talks on our [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Statusim/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid) and plenty of other content including our company stand-ups. Take a look through [State of Us](https://our.status.im/state-of-us/)

## Tools/Platforms

We use a variety of tools & platforms and encourage everyone to use their own preferences depending on the role that is being hired, this includes new job boards, platforms & tools that haven't been used before. Generally we track all the platforms in use [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G1Wy5EKeZX_c8zzA2TZ_NFw6UgdeEqoro2aSAieTHLQ/edit#gid=1196731026) and edit them as we go

We like to work smart, meaning using platforms that will get the best results & attract the right candidates and that can be discussed with the hiring teams too, as some of them have preferences about where we find talent.
