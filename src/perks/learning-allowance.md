# üéì Learning allowance

If you're someone who gets a kick from continuing to learn and grow, we want to be supportive of your aspirations! At the same time, we're mindful of our limitations to support the variety of opportunities you might want to access (i.e., from a coding course to a graduate program).

We offer an annual learning budget of 150 EUR for each core contributor. You can use this budget towards things like books, conferences, or online courses. Speak with your team lead to request additional funding if needed.

Please [file this expense](src/finance/expense-reimbusements.md) and indicate what learning is for in the comment box.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Team leads: if there's room in your budget, you can approve learning requests directly. Otherwise, create a [funding request](./finance/requesting-funding.md).
