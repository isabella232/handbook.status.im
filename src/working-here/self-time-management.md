# ‚è≥ Self-time management

Status is a results-oriented workplace ‚Äìmeaning that we care about your output (the results you deliver), not your input (the number of hours you work).

We don't mandate the days, schedule, or hours that you work ‚Äìyou're free to set your working schedule and work from any workspace (home/coffee shop/coworking space) and timezone that works for you.

This way of working might be new to you, and if you'd like some guidance on self-time management or have any concerns about being productive ‚Äìfeel free to chat with anyone on the People Ops team who will be happy to coach you.

## üéì Learning Time

If you haven't already, read about our [learning allowance](./perks/learning-allowance.md).

We encourage using working hours to learn about things related to your work and our collective mission. Make your team aware of you being on/offline and that the team's progress doesn't get hindered. Feel free to discuss it openly and agree on timing with everyone involved.

If you need a reference, a full-time contributor could spend their first 1-4 weeks spending 10-20 hours p/w to learn and ~2-5 hours p/w after that on an ongoing basis. This is just an example, and we encourage you to figure out a learning cadence that best helps you succeed in contributing to Status.
