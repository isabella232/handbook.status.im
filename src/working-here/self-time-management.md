# ‚è≥ Self-time management

Status is a results-oriented orgnization ‚Äìmeaning that we care about your output (the results you deliver), not your input (the number of hours you take to deliver the output).

We don't mandate the days, schedule, or hours that you take to deliver the services ‚Äìyou're free to set your schedule and work from any place (home/coffee shop/coworking space) and timezone.

This system might be new to you, and if you'd like some guidance on self-time management or have any concerns about being productive ‚Äìfeel free to chat with anyone on the People Ops team who will be happy to coach you.

## üéì Learning Time

If you haven't already, read about our [learning allowance](./perks/learning-allowance.md).

We encourage using some time to learn about things related to your tasks and our collective mission. Make your peers aware of you being on/offline and that the team's progress doesn't get hindered. Feel free to discuss it openly and agree on timing with everyone involved.

If you need a reference, a regular contributor could spend their first 1-4 weeks spending 50% of their billed hours to learn and ~2-5 hours p/w after that on an ongoing basis. This is just an example, and we encourage you to figure out a learning cadence that best helps you succeed in contributing to Status.
